# This file matches the Apache v.2.4.27 configuration that is compatible with
# npg_ranger v2.0.0 and up.
#
# The Apache server acts as a reverse proxy for the npg_ranger server.
# It also performs OpenID Connect user authentication.
# The server hosts static files for the dalliance genome browser
# and server reference files fir this browser.

# Compilation configuration for Apache v. 2.4.27
# The modules we definitely want are explicitly enabled.
# The disabled modules will not be compiled.  LDAP-dependant modules do not compile on
